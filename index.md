## Hi there!
My name is Mariusz, and I am a senior software engineer
in [IBM Research](https://www.research.ibm.com/).
I have been working there since 1997.
My research interests are system management and distributed,
scalable environments in Hybrid Cloud.
My current focus is security, identity, and secret management in Kubernetes environments.

I co-authored several technical papers and filed over 20 patents.
