# My Technical Notes
Here is a collection of my technical notes based on involvement with various
projects and activities while working with smart people in IBM and IBM Research.

While most of the notes were more or less accurate when written, they are subjective,
therefore I don't take any responsibility for their quality, no liability for
anything related to them and I give no warranties :)
